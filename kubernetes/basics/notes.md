- kubernetes: open source **container orchestration** tool
- as many system use microserves and sometimes a lot of services, there is a need for a tool that can manage those services
- an orchestration tool offer:
    - high availability or no downtime
    - scalability or high performance
    - disaster recovery - backup and restore
- worker nodes have more resources because they do most of the work
- master nodes have is the most important node, because if we lose it we lose access to our cluster, that's we should always have a buckup for master, at least 2 masters in a kubernestes cluster
- the virtual network allow all the nodes to talk to each others, it turn all the nodes into one unified powerful machine
- pods are the smallest component
- pod is a wrapper of a container
- usualy one pod per application
- each pod is it self contained server
- a sevice have 2 main roles: provide a permanent ip adress, load balancer
